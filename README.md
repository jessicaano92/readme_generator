# readme_generator

## Description

This README_generator allows for the typical user flow through with this application. It includes a gif at the bottom of this README with views of prompts and the responses after they are selected. It asks for the user's name, email, Github username, installation, tests, contribution, license, project name, project description, and the usage. 
I built this homework with trying to understand how to generate a good README along with understanding the coding and logic behind it. 


## Installation

JSON, path, inquirer, fs
